Wymp TSConfigs
=========================================================================

*A repo containing various preconfigured tsconfig files for the way we usually set things up*

**NOTE: This is still a work in progress.**

This repo largely extends https://github.com/tsconfig/base tsconfig files with some additional settings that I typically
prefer in my projects.
